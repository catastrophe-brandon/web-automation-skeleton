# web-automation-skeleton
A basic skeleton for building web automation using Python w/ Selenium.

## Pre-reqs
Python (duh), pip, virtualenv, yada yada yada

To use these tests you'll need to install the appropriate driver for the desired browser
- For Firefox on Mac you can issue "brew install geckodriver"
- For IE do IE things (TODO: figure this out)
- For Chrome "brew install chromedriver" and then run chromedriver.

## Running Tests

You'll need to set up your virtual environment, activate it, install required packages, then run main.py.

    # virtualenv -p python3.6 env
    # source env/bin/activate
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    # python main.py
